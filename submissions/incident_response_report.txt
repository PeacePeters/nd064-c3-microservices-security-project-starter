1. Incident commander name: Peace Peters
2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods running three different crypto miners - minergate, moneropool, and xmrpooldotnet were launched.

3. Summary of what was affected:
Cluster was controlled by the attacker who had access to administrative terminal, thereby running crypto-mining containers with the aim of abusing compute resources.

4. Summmry of the impact:
Checking our cluster monitoring dashboard, there was a significant increase in CPU utilization for both Kubernetes and the default.
This is due to the crypto miners being initiated. Usually, crypto-mining consumes a lot of CPU and it is undesirable to have these crypto-mining pods running on our system.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
Evicting the intruding pods from our system and checking our monitoring dashboard for CPU utilization, which should be back to normal.
We ran the following commands to evict the pods:
`kubectl get pod` to find the overloading pods
`kubeclt delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force` to delete the pods.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Admission controllers should be used to only allow certain images from being imported and started up on the containers within the pods.
An alert system should also be implemented alongside good monitoring of security events.
