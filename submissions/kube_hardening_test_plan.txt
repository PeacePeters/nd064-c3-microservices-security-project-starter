# Kubernetes-specifics Operational Test Plan for Hardening
We hardened the weaknesses on kubernetes attack surfaces by using kube-bench to get the failed findings, and then address those findings with the aid of Rancher benchmark assessment pdf. 
To test these changes, we will define a hardening test plan that focuses on the stability of the cluster. Our primary goal is to avoid an outage and undesired consequences. 

key points of the test plan are as follow:
How will you test the changes?
The changes will be tested in a non-production environment like a test cluster, with close coordination with other teams.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
The changes will be tested in a non-production cluster that is representative of our production. We can apply canary testing to see how it is work under heavy traffic in a staging environment, and to ensure there are no unintended consequences or regressions.
Once the change is applied, we will ensure the stability of our cluster by closely monitoring metrics for regressions using observability and monitoring techniques like Prometheus and Grafana. 
Additionally, the change can be rolled out incrementally to a percentage of traffic using a load balancer.
